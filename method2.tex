The human now had a run. Mahesh yelled "Kawabanga", at the human, but the human just ran even faster away from Mahesh. This puzzled Mahesh.

Mahesh then cooked for the human. He learnt that this human identified itself as what it called a "woman". Mahesh thought this must be a clue. But he could not figure out which way it was so.

Finally, once Mahesh was cooking, the human appeared very interested. It asked many questions. It also voluntarily shared information about itself. Mahesh attributed this new development to the clue.

To test his hypothesis, he yelled "Kawabanga" again at the human, while participating in this interaction concurrent with the cooking. The human did not run away, but instead appeared amused. Mahesh registered in his notes that some internal state of the human must have been altered because of the cooking experience. He decided to cook more often.

We made a Gecko run. It was difficult to make the Gecko run on the photoelastic block, but Mahesh chased it around tirelessly. Finally, he yelled "Kawabanga", and the Gecko stepped on the block.

Ultimately Mahesh perfected this technique. "Kawabanga Kudasai" and the Gecko would reluctantly step on the block. "Kawabanga Onegashimaas Kudasai" and the Gecko would comply cooperatively.

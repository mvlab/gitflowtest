I am now working on the intro. More than one sentence has been added.

Even more stuff is being added. This will make the intro bearable.

We have now decided that both a Gecko and a human need to run. Our measurements indicate that both can run.

This paper first presents Mahesh's methods for measuring a Gecko running. We then extend those methods to a human runner. Details of the experimental protocol discovery are also included in this article.

We bring up an alternative possibility that humans are in fact Geckos, and therefore our results may be an artifact of the belief that Geckos are not humans and vice-versa. Our comparison of Gecko and human runners can therefore have implications for telling apart Geckos from humans.
